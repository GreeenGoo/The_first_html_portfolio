<h1>Who is Vlad</h1>
<p>
Hey! My name is Vlad and I am looking for a challenging and innovative environment where my skills can make a
difference from day one and where I can grow professionally by contributing to application
development, testing and prototyping, creating documentation, making design and actively
participating in the agile processes.</p>

<p>I'm 28 years old. I have two degrees in the field of programming. They both are specified in
my CV. In college and university, I learned Pascal ABC, Delphi, C++, and C#.</p>

<p>After university, I started to learn Java and a bit later Kotlin to learn Android Development. I
learned and practiced such instruments and libraries as MVVM, Retrofit, Coroutines, Room
Database, Hilt, Koin, View Binding, OkHttp, RecyclerView, Glide, Navigation UI, Animations,
Material Design, and more. Links to my projects are in my CV. The readme file of each of
them says about the structure of every app and its instrumental base. I also learned Figma
to create interfaces for my apps.Except for making projects I passed some Udemy courses and now I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>

<p>From July 2023 I've been participating in a start-up. I am a Mobile Developer there and not
Android because to make our product we use Flutter and Dart which are universal
languages not only for Android but also for IOS. In collaboration with our team, we make the
code and the design, create new features, update the interface, and fix bugs (link to the
presentation of the project you can find in my CV). Unfortunately, I can't discuss a lot about
the internal structure of the project but I can say that we mostly work with Firebase
(Firestore, RTDB, Crashlytics, Google and Apple Authentication, and more). We work a lot
with GitHub making new branches and committing and pushing changes. We also work with
PlayStore and AppStore. Later I'm going to learn more about design and testing and plan to learn SWIFT.</p>

<p>I would be happy to demonstrate my skills by implementing a demo application given the
requirements or discuss my capabilities more in an interview.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your connection!</p>
